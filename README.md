If you index a DataFrame with a single value or a list of values, it selects the columns.

```
(golf_df['Humidity']>90) | (golf_df['Outlook']=="Sunny") # '|' is 'OR'
(golf_df['Result']=="Don't Play") & golf_df['Windy'] # '&' is 'AND'
```

## Week 2
#### Day 3 | Maximum likelihood estimator

```
# these are the imports from the module
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats as stats
import scipy.optimize as optim

from itertools import product
```

## Week 5
#### Day 1 | Maximum likelihood estimator
